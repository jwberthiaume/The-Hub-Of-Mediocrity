                <p>Greetings, Internet. Welcome to the Hub.</p> 

<p>If you're reading this, you must be lost. Surely you didn't intend to come here. This site, like a cul de sac, is not often visited by anyone that doesn't have an explicit need to come here. So far I am the only one with any real reason to visit. I come here to experiment and create. This is my sandbox. This is where my interests converge into a single repository of self-expression and self-indulgence.</p>

<p>Sites like this are commonplace nowadays. The web is teeming with narcissistic and marginally creative "individuals" trying to be heard above the cacophony of unsolicited opinions and presentations. I'm no different I guess. All I know is something compels me to reach out, to communicate. I'm not sure why. I suppose I have something to say though I'm skeptical that it needs to be said. I'm certain it's been said before. Never-the-less, here I am, building this site for some nebulous reason that I don't fully understand.</p>

<p>I like the idea that someone might stumble upon this site and take something meaningful from it. It's a little empty right now but I'll be building it up over time. Most people probably build the whole site first and then launch but this was never menat to be a big production. It's just some random guy making it up as he goes along. That pretty well sums up my life thus far, actually. Maybe you can relate.</p>

<p>Please check back periodically. There will likely be something new if you do. For now, the blog is likely to be the most active since it requires the least amount of effort to create that type of content. The music and images will come shortly.</p>

<p>Thanks and welcome to The Hub Of Mediocrity.</p>
